# 14930352
F<sub>i</sub> = F<sub>i-1</sub> + F<sub>i-2</sub>

A clone of [2584](https://oxguy3.github.io/2584/) with faster game pace.

A small fork of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), which is a clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](https://thereal9877.github.io/2048-Fibonacci/)

That screenshot is fake, by the way. I never reached 14930352 :smile:
